# [001] Two Sum

## Problem Description
- [**Link:**](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/)

**Statement**:
- Given an array of integers <div>nums</div> and an integer <div>target</div>, return <em>indices of the two number such that they add up </em> to the target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not assume to have the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.
  
- **Example 1**:
  - Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15] target = 9
  - Output: [0, 1]
  - Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1]

 - **Example 2**:
  - Input: nums = [3, 2 4] target = 6
  - Output: [1, 2]

- **Example 3**:
  - Input: nums = [3, 3] target = 6
  - Output: [0, 1]

  - **Constraints**:
    2 <= nums.length <= $10^4$
    $-10^9$ <= nums[i] <= $10^9$
    $-10^9$ <= target <= $10^9$

    **Only one answer exists**
