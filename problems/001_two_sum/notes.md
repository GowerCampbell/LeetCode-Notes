# My Understanding of 001 two sum

## Whatâ€™s confusing: 
Everything at the start, I am struggling on implementing my python language on my own, for instance what are indices? and how does creating a function do an operation on my list equal to the target? I feel like I'm struggling to understand a key concept in this math that will change the way I think about writing my code to find a sum out of an array of numbers. Why does it come out as [0, 1] or [1, 2] and [0,1] in the examples.

## Analogy: 
**"After counting the number of boxes you have, which two boxes contains the amount of fruit I can add together on my self to reach the targeted amount."**

## Key Insight: 
I researched indices as I needed to know what the task was asking for... and it came to my attention it is an index of a small number that tells us how many times a term has been multiplied or in this case what numbers need to plush by itself, and now things are making sense. 

If you count the amount of values starting from 0 in the range we are given from list. I can find the target by finding the two values that I can add together in the integer list that will add to find my targetted number.
