# My Understanding of LeetCode #2: Add Two Numbers

## Problem Overview
The task is to add two numbers represented as linked lists, where each node contains a single digit, and the digits are stored in **reverse order**. The result should also be a linked list in reverse order. For example, `2 -> 4 -> 3` represents 342, and `5 -> 6 -> 4` represents 465. Adding them gives 807, returned as `7 -> 0 -> 8`.

## What's Confusing
The core mechanics of adding digits from two linked lists and handling the carry can be tricky. Specifically, extracting digits and managing the linked list structure (nodes, pointers, and iteration) feels complex. The operations `carry = total // 10` and `digit = total % 10` are particularly confusing.

Especilly, I got caught on an error where I hadn't correctly written the ListNode when I can use ListNode(total % 10) to cretae a newNode to store the data for the next value, repepersenting the one digit.

## Analogy
Imagine a card game where each card shows a digit, and the cards are stacked in reverse order (ones place at the bottom, tens place above, etc.). Your job is to add the numbers represented by two stacks and create a new stack for the sum, also in reverse order. If the sum of two digits exceeds 9, you "carry over" an extra card to the next stack.

## Key Insights

### What is a Linked List?
A linked list is like a chain of nodes, where each node contains:
- A digit (`val`), representing a single digit of the number.
- A pointer (`next`) to the next node in the chain.
- The last node points to `None` (end of the list).

For example, `2 -> 4 -> 3` represents the number 342 in reverse order:
- Node 1: `val = 2`, `next` points to Node 2.
- Node 2: `val = 4`, `next` points to Node 3.
- Node 3: `val = 3`, `next = None`.

### Visualizing the Addition
Given two linked lists:
- `l1 = 2 -> 4 -> 3` (342)
- `l2 = 5 -> 6 -> 4` (465)

We add them digit by digit, starting from the ones place, and handle carries:
1. **Ones place**: `2 + 5 = 7`. No carry. Result node: `7`.
2. **Tens place**: `4 + 6 = 10`. Write `0`, carry `1`. Result node: `0`.
3. **Hundreds place**: `3 + 4 + 1 (carry) = 8`. No carry. Result node: `8`.
4. **Final result**: `7 -> 0 -> 8` (807 in reverse order).

### Key Operations Explained
The operations `carry = total // 10` and `digit = total % 10` are critical for extracting the carry and the current digit:
- **Modulo (`total % 10`)**: Gets the last digit of the sum. For example, if `total = 18`, then `18 % 10 = 8`, which is the digit to store in the current node.
- **Integer Division (`total // 10`)**: Determines the carry. For example, `18 // 10 = 1`, which is the carry to pass to the next digit.

These operations split the sum into:
- The digit to keep in the current node (`total % 10`).
- The carry to add to the next pair of digits (`total // 10`).

### Code Mechanics
Hereâ€™s how the solution works step-by-step:
1. **Initialize**:
   - Create a dummy node to simplify list construction.
   - Set a `current` pointer to build the result list.
   - Initialize `carry = 0`.

2. **Iterate**:
   - While there are digits in `l1`, `l2`, or a carry exists:
     - Get digits: `x = l1.val if l1 else 0`, `y = l2.val if l2 else 0`.
     - Compute `total = x + y + carry`.
     - Create a new node with `newNode = ListNode(total % 10)`
     - Links the newly created newNode to the current node's 'next' pointer
       ```python
       current.next = newNode
       current = newNode
       ```
     - Updates the current value with the newNode, prepairing for the next digit of the new current node and linking it.  
     - Update the carry: `carry = total // 10`.
     - Move pointers:
       ```python
       current = current.next
       l1 = l1.next if l1 else None
       l2 = l2.next if l2 else None
       ```

3. **Return**: The result list starts from `dummy.next`.

### Why These Lines Matter
- **`current.next = ListNode(digit)`**: Creates a new node with the computed digit and attaches it to the result list.
- **`current = current.next`**: Moves the `current` pointer to the newly created node for the next iteration.
- **`l1 = l1.next if l1 else None` and `l2 = l2.next if l2 else None`**: Advances the pointers to the next digits in `l1` and `l2`. If a list is exhausted, it sets the pointer to `None` to stop accessing it.

### Putting It Together
These operations work together to:
1. Add a new digit to the result list (`current.next = ListNode(digit)`).
2. Move the result pointer to the new node (`current = current.next`).
3. Advance the input lists to their next digits (`l1 = l1.next`, `l2 = l2.next`).
4. Handle the carry for the next iteration.
