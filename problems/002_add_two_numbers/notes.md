# My Understanding of 002 add two numbers

## Whatâ€™s confusing: 
I think its the core mechanics and how it all comes together, especially when your extracting numbers from an operation and then reversing them into a list with an array of numbers.


## Analogy: 
**"."**

## Key Insight: 
Researching the use of linked lists; each car holds a digit and a pointer to the next car. The last cae points to nothing (none)
Reverse order: The number is written backward in the list.
Carry: When adding numbers (9 + 9 = 18) you write down 8 nd carru 1 to the next digit.
