# Tips for Solving LeetCode Problems

These tips are designed to help you approach LeetCode problems systematically, with a focus on clarity and efficiency. They incorporate neurodivergent-friendly strategies but are useful for anyone.

## 1. Break Problems into Tiny Steps
- **Why**: Simplifying a problem into small steps makes it less daunting and easier to track progress.
- **How**:
  - Read the problem slowly and list each requirement as a bullet point.
  - Example: For a problem asking for a sum, note: ‚ÄúFind numbers, check their sum, return indices.‚Äù
  - Solve one step at a time, testing as you go (e.g., print intermediate results).
  - Use a checklist to mark completed steps.

## 2. Use Analogies
- **Why**: Analogies make abstract problems relatable and memorable.
- **How**:
  - Compare the problem to a real-world scenario. For example:
    - Two Sum: ‚ÄúFinding two ingredients in a pantry that combine to make a specific recipe.‚Äù
    - Sorting: ‚ÄúOrganizing books on a shelf by height.‚Äù
  - Write the analogy in your notes to ground your understanding.
  - Use it to explain the problem to someone else (or yourself).

## 3. Visualize
- **Why**: Diagrams clarify data structures and logic flow.
- **How**:
  - Draw the problem‚Äôs input and output:
    - Arrays: Boxes with indices and values.
    - Linked Lists: Arrows connecting nodes.
    - Trees/Graphs: Nodes and edges.
  - Use online tools like Excalidraw or draw by hand.
  - Include visuals in your problem notes for quick reference.
  - Example: For Two Sum, draw an array with arrows showing which numbers sum to the target.

## 4. Color-Code
- **Why**: Colors highlight important parts, making code and notes easier to navigate.
- **How**:
  - In notes, use different colors for problem parts (e.g., green for examples, red for key insights).
  - In code, add colored comments or use editor themes to differentiate:
    - Variables: Blue comments.
    - Logic: Green comments.
    - Edge cases: Red comments.
  - Example:
    ```python
    # üîµ Initialize variables
    total = 0
    # üî¥ Loop through data
    for num in nums:
        # üü¢ Update result
        total += num
    ```

## 5. Take Breaks
- **Why**: Breaks prevent burnout and help your brain process ideas subconsciously.
- **How**:
  - Work in short bursts (e.g., 25 minutes on, 5 minutes off).
  - Do a quick activity during breaks: stretch, drink water, or use a fidget tool.
  - If stuck, take a longer break (15‚Äì30 minutes) and jot down your current thoughts.
  - Return with a fresh question, like ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the simplest next step?‚Äù

## 6. Talk It Out
- **Why**: Verbalizing or writing a narrative clarifies your thought process.
- **How**:
  - Explain the problem aloud as if teaching it to someone.
  - Write a ‚Äústory‚Äù version of the problem. Example:
    - Two Sum: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm searching a list of treasures for two that combine to a total value.‚Äù
  - Use a voice recorder or text-to-speech tool if writing is challenging.
  - Discuss with a study group or on platforms like X for new perspectives.

## General Tips
- **Start with Easy Problems**: Build confidence with simpler problems before tackling mediums or hards.
- **Test Incrementally**: Run your code with small inputs to catch errors early.
- **Learn Patterns**: Group problems by technique (e.g., hash maps, two pointers) to reuse solutions.
- **Use Resources**: Watch videos (e.g., NeetCode), read LeetCode discussions, or search X for tips.
- **Track Progress**: Keep a log of solved problems and what strategies worked.

## Tools
- **Coding**: VS Code, LeetCode‚Äôs online editor, or Jupyter notebooks.
- **Notes**: Markdown files in GitHub, Notion, or a physical journal.
- **Visuals**: Excalidraw, Canva, or graph paper.
- **Community**: X, LeetCode forums, or Discord study groups.
