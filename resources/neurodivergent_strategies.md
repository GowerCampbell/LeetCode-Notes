# Neurodivergent Strategies for Solving LeetCode Problems

This document outlines strategies that work for neurodivergent minds when tackling LeetCode problems. These approaches are designed to reduce overwhelm, enhance understanding, and make problem-solving more engaging and intuitive.

## 1. Break Problems into Tiny Steps
- **Why it helps**: Large problems can feel chaotic or insurmountable. Breaking them into small, manageable steps creates a clear path and reduces cognitive overload.
- **How to do it**:
  - Read the problem and write down each part as a single sentence or bullet point.
  - Example for Two Sum: 
    - Step 1: Understand I need two numbers that add to a target.
    - Step 2: Return their positions (indices), not the numbers.
    - Step 3: Try checking pairs or using a faster method like a dictionary.
  - Use a notebook, sticky notes, or a digital tool like Notion to list steps.
  - Check off each step as you complete it to feel a sense of progress.

## 2. Use Analogies
- **Why it helps**: Analogies connect abstract coding concepts to familiar real-world scenarios, making problems less intimidating and easier to visualize.
- **How to do it**:
  - Create a story or metaphor for the problem. For example:
    - Two Sum: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like finding two puzzle pieces in a box that fit together to make the target number.‚Äù
    - Binary Search: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like flipping through a phone book, skipping half the pages each time to find a name.‚Äù
  - Write the analogy in your notes before coding to anchor your understanding.
  - If stuck, try explaining the problem as if it‚Äôs a game or a task in a story.

## 3. Visualize
- **Why it helps**: Visuals turn abstract data (like arrays or trees) into concrete images, which can be easier to process for visual thinkers.
- **How to do it**:
  - Sketch the problem‚Äôs data structure:
    - Arrays: Draw boxes with indices and values (e.g., `[2, 7, 11, 15]` as labeled boxes).
    - Trees: Draw nodes and branches to see relationships.
    - Graphs: Use dots and lines to map connections.
  - Use tools like [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/), paper, or a tablet.
  - Save diagrams in your problem folder (e.g., `visual.png`) and reference them in notes.
  - Example: For Two Sum, draw arrows between indices 0 and 1 to show `2 + 7 = 9`.

## 4. Color-Code
- **Why it helps**: Colors draw attention to key parts of code or notes, making it easier to focus and avoid missing details.
- **How to do it**:
  - In notes, use colored pens or highlighters for different sections (e.g., blue for problem description, red for challenges).
  - In code, use comments with emojis or labels to highlight:
    - üîµ Variables (e.g., `# üîµ Store numbers here`).
    - üî¥ Loops (e.g., `# üî¥ Check each number`).
    - üü¢ Key logic (e.g., `# üü¢ Found the solution!`).
  - Use syntax-highlighting editors like VS Code with colorful themes.
  - Example for Two Sum:
    ```python
    def twoSum(nums, target):
        seen = {}  # üîµ Dictionary to store numbers and indices
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):  # üî¥ Loop through array
            complement = target - num
            if complement in seen:  # üü¢ Check if pair exists
                return [seen[complement], i]
            seen[num] = i  # üîµ Add number to dictionary
        return []
    ```

## 5. Take Breaks
- **Why it helps**: Neurodivergent brains can hyperfocus or burn out. Breaks prevent frustration and let your subconscious process ideas.
- **How to do it**:
  - Set a timer (e.g., 25 minutes of focus, 5-minute break, like the Pomodoro technique).
  - Step away from the screen: walk, stretch, or do a quick sensory activity (e.g., fidget toy).
  - If stuck, take a longer break (15‚Äì30 minutes) and return with a fresh perspective.
  - Before breaking, write down where you‚Äôre stuck to pick up easily later.

## 6. Talk It Out
- **Why it helps**: Verbalizing or writing a narrative helps process complex ideas and clarifies your thoughts.
- **How to do it**:
  - Explain the problem aloud to yourself, a friend, or even a pet (rubber duck debugging).
  - Write a ‚Äústory‚Äù version of the problem in your notes. For example:
    - Two Sum: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a librarian with a list of books (numbers). Someone wants two books whose page counts add up to 9. I need to tell them which shelves (indices) those books are on.‚Äù
  - Record a voice memo if writing feels slow, then transcribe key points.
  - Use this to identify where you‚Äôre confused and focus your learning.

## Additional Strategies
- **Chunk Time**: Work on one problem for a set time (e.g., 1 hour) to avoid feeling overwhelmed by multiple problems.
- **Celebrate Wins**: After solving a problem, note what worked well (e.g., ‚ÄúThe analogy helped me understand!‚Äù) to build confidence.
- **Use Patterns**: Group problems by type (e.g., hash map, two pointers) to recognize similarities.
- **Seek Community**: Check X or Reddit for others‚Äô explanations, but filter for clarity to avoid information overload.

## Tools to Support You
- **Notetaking**: Notion, Obsidian, or a physical notebook for structured notes.
- **Visuals**: Excalidraw, Canva, or paper for diagrams.
- **Coding**: VS Code with colorful extensions (e.g., Rainbow Brackets).
- **Breaks**: Timer apps like Forest or Focus@Will for neurodivergent-friendly focus sessions.
