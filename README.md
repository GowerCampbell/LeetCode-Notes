# LeetCode-Notes

Welcome to my **LeetCode-Notes** repository! This is my personal collection of notes, solutions, and strategies for solving [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems, designed with a neurodivergent-friendly approach. As someone with a neurodivergent brain, I often find coding problems overwhelming or confusing (like struggling with Two Sum’s focus on indices instead of values). This repository organizes my thought process, analogies, visuals, and step-by-step breakdowns to make problem-solving clearer and more manageable.

## Purpose
This repository is a space to:
- Document my solutions to LeetCode problems with clear explanations.
- Break down problems into small, digestible steps to reduce overwhelm.
- Use analogies, visuals, and color-coding to make concepts intuitive.
- Track my progress and revisit challenges with fresh insights.
- Share strategies that work for neurodivergent minds (e.g., ADHD, autism, dyslexia).

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized to keep notes consistent and easy to navigate:

- **problems/**: Each problem has its own folder (e.g., `001_two_sum`), containing a README, solution code, detailed notes, and optional visuals.
- **templates/**: A standard template to ensure consistent note-taking.
- **resources/**: Tips and strategies for solving problems, with a focus on neurodivergent approaches.

## How to Use This Repository
1. **Browse Problems**: Check the `problems/` folder for specific LeetCode problems. Each folder includes:
   - A `README.md` with the problem description and links.
   - A `solution.py` with my code (often in Python).
   - A `notes.md` with my thought process, analogies, and neurodivergent challenges.
   - A `visual.png` (if included) to illustrate the problem visually.
2. **Learn Strategies**: Read `resources/neurodivergent_strategies.md` for tips tailored to neurodivergent minds, like breaking problems into tiny steps or using analogies.
3. **General Tips**: See `resources/tips.md` for broader LeetCode problem-solving advice.
4. **Contribute**: If you’re a collaborator or want to suggest improvements, open an issue or pull request!

## Why Neurodivergent-Friendly?
As a neurodivergent coder, I find LeetCode problems can feel chaotic or hard to process. For example, the Two Sum problem confused me because I focused on the numbers instead of their indices. To address this, I:
- Break problems into small steps to avoid overwhelm.
- Use analogies (e.g., Two Sum as finding puzzle pieces).
- Visualize data structures with sketches or diagrams.
- Color-code notes and code to highlight key parts.
- Take breaks to reset when stuck.
- Talk through problems aloud or in writing to clarify thoughts.

Check `resources/neurodivergent_strategies.md` for more details on these techniques.
